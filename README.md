Analysis of Mars Weather Data at Curiosity's Location

We obtained Mars weather data from the provided Mars News Site using web scraping techniques. The data included various parameters such as Martian sols, terrestrial dates, solar longitude (ls), months, temperatures (in Celsius), and atmospheric pressure (in Pascal).

We calculated the average minimum temperature for each month to identify the coldest and hottest months.

We visualized the data by creating a bar chart and the chart displayed the average minimum temperatures for each month.

The analysis revealed the coldest and hottest months at Curiosity's location on Mars.

Finally, we exported the cleaned and analyzed data to a CSV file.
